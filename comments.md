# Comments

Most languages have two concepts of comments: single-line and multi-line. GLS supports both.

### Single Line Comments

Use the `comment line` command. It takes in any number of parameters and directly outputs them.

```
comment line : Hello world!
```

* In C\#: `// Hello world!`
* In Python: `# Hello world!`

### Multi Line Comments
