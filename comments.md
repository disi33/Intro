# Comments

Most languages have two concepts of comments: single-line and multi-line. GLS supports both.

### Single Line Comments

Use the `comment line` command. It takes in any number of parameters and directly outputs them.

```
comment line : Hello world!
```

* In C\#: `// Hello world!`
* In Python: `# Hello world!`

### Multi Line Comments

Also known as "block" comments, these are preceded by `comment block start` and ended with `comment block end`. Each line of actual block content comes from `comment block`, which, like `comment line`, directly prints all its parameters.

```
comment block start
comment block : Hello world!
comment block end
```

In C\#:

```csharp
/*
 * Hello world!
 */
```

In Python:

```python
"""
Hello world!
"""
```
