# General Language Syntax \(GLS\)

A unified syntax that compiles into your favorite OOP languages.

### Theory

Most object-oriented programming languages today are "pretty much" the same. Declaring variables, PEMDAS operations, calling functions, and so on rarely change; the base concept of a compiled or scripting language with managed memory is very common.

GLS provides a common syntax to describe programming functionality in these common managed languages.`.gls`files can be compiled into any of the supported languages, and will work the same in all of them.
